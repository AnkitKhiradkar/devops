export custom (required java version) in .bash_profile  // I m using amz linux here

for the jenkin version  i m currently using it requires java jdk 11 version, somehow java 1.8.x jdk is not
working for me. thus i have given custom java path so that it will only pick java jdk 11 in case
both java jdk 11 and java jdk 1.8.x installed


note : i m deploying jenkins war on tomcat server
